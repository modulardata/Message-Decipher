<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>Welcome to the final stage, Agent! Your mission reaches its climax as you take command of the encryption process. In this stage, you'll harness the power of a custom shift cipher to encode the contents of the "message.txt" file and store them securely in a new file called "encoded-message.txt".</p><p>Using the <code class="java">sync-input</code> library, you will prompt to enter the desired shift value through the console. Once you get the shift value, the program will read the contents of the "message.txt" file and encode each message using the specified shift cipher. The encoded messages will then be written to the "encoded-message.txt" file, ensuring their protection and accessibility for authorized individuals.</p><p>Here's an example of how the encoding process works with a shift value of 3, suppose we have the following message:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello, Agent.</code></pre><p>To encode this message using a shift value of 3, each letter is shifted three positions to the right in the alphabet. For example, 'A' maps to 'D', 'B' maps to 'E', 'Z' maps to 'C', and so on. Applying the shift, the encoded message would be:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Khoor, Djhqw.</code></pre><p>Remember you need to perform the previous operations first before taking the input. You can enter any input message you like and remember to convert the input to <strong>Number</strong>.</p><p>While keeping the old messages, after encoding the message, log this new message: <code class="java">Finished encoding the file</code> and after writing: <code class="java">Finished writing the file</code></p><p>Good luck, Agent! The success of our mission rests in your hands, and protecting these encoded secrets is of utmost importance.</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>In this stage, your program should:</p><ul><li><p>Keep the previous decoding processes as is.</p></li><li><p>Take the input for the cipher shift.</p></li><li><p>Read the contents of <code class="java">message.txt</code> file.</p></li><li><p>Encode the <code class="java">message.txt</code> file with the new cipher.</p></li><li><p>Create a new text file called <code class="java">encoded-message.txt</code></p></li><li><p>Write the encoded message to the new file.</p></li><li><p>Log the message: <code class="java">Finished encoding the file</code></p></li><li><p>Log the message: <code class="java">Finished writing the file</code></p></li></ul><h5 id="examples">Examples</h5><p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input.

Finished writing the file
Enter the shift number: &gt; 3
