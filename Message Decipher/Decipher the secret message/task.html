<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>Welcome back, Agent, to the second stage of the project! Your mission intensifies as you have found out that the message is using the <em>Atbash cipher</em> for encryption.</p><p>The Atbash cipher is a special technique that swaps each letter of the alphabet with its counterpart from the opposite end. For example, 'A' becomes 'Z', 'B' becomes 'Y', and so on. This method helps us transform the encrypted messages into their original form.</p><p>Let me provide you with an example of how the Atbash cipher works. Suppose we have the following encrypted message: </p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Svokg rh z tlrmt ozgvh.</code></pre><p>To decode this message using the Atbash cipher, we replace each letter with its counterpart from the opposite end of the alphabet. Applying the cipher, we get:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello is a glint light.</code></pre><p>Now, with this powerful knowledge, you will employ Node.js to apply the Atbash cipher algorithm to every character of the encrypted messages. As a result, the console will display the decrypted messages, revealing their hidden meaning.</p><p>After decoding the message log this new message instead of the old one: <code class="java">Finished decoding the file</code></p><p>Watch out for the cases of the letters, make sure to match them with the original text!</p><p>Each decrypted message brings you closer to the truth, shedding light on the covert operations and hidden agendas. This stage marks a significant breakthrough in our mission, as we gain access to the decrypted messages, ready to be analyzed and deciphered further.</p><p>Good luck, Agent. Let the decryption operation commence!</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>In this stage, your program should:</p><ul><li><p>Decode the secret message with the Atbash cipher.</p></li><li><p>Log the result to the console in lowercase.</p></li><li><p>Log the message: <code class="java">Finished decoding the file</code></p></li></ul><h5 id="examples">Examples</h5><p>Example 1: <em>The actual message is not shown</em></p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">-- decoded message here --

Finished decoding the file</code></pre>
