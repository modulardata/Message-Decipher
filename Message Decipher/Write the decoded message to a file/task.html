<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>In this stage, your mission now shifts to preserving the valuable decoded messages by securely storing them in a new file called <code class="java">decoded-message.txt</code>.</p>
<p>After successfully decoding the encrypted messages using the Atbash cipher, it's of utmost importance to protect the revealed information from falling into the wrong hands. To achieve this, we will harness the power of Node.js to create a classified repository.</p>
<p>Agent, your expertise in Node.js will be crucial as you complete this vital stage. As you write the decoded messages to a new file, remember the weight of the secrets you protect. The future of our mission depends on your ability to secure and preserve the decrypted information. You can replace the file if it already exists!</p>
<p>While keeping the old message after decoding the file, after writing the message to a new file, log this new message too: <code class="java">Finished writing the file</code></p>
<p>Stay vigilant, Agent, as you proceed with this critical phase of the project. The secrets are counting on you to keep them safe within the confines of the new file.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the previous decoding process without logging the result to the console.</li>
<li>Create a new text file called <code class="java">decoded-message.txt</code></li>
<li>Write the decoded message to the new file.</li>
<li>Log the message: <code class="java">Finished writing the file</code></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Finished decoding the file
Finished writing the file</code></pre>
