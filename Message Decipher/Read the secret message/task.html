<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Welcome to the first stage, Agent! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to gather encrypted messages from a confidential text file: <code class="java">secret-message.txt</code> and log them to the console.</p>
<p>Using the power of Node.js, you will navigate through the digital realm, accessing the hidden secrets within the file. Your task is to extract the encrypted messages, which are encoded to keep them secure.</p>
<p>With precision and skill, you will command the console to display the encrypted messages. Each line of code you execute brings you closer to unraveling the mystery. The console becomes your ally, showcasing the encrypted secrets as you decode the digital puzzle.</p>
<p>Your objective is to ensure that the program successfully reads the encrypted messages from the file and displays them accurately in the console. This stage sets the foundation for the subsequent decryption operations that lie ahead.</p>
<p>After logging the contents of the file, output this message: <code class="java">Finished reading the file</code> to let other agents know that the process is finished!</p>
<p>Good luck, Agent. This message will self-destruct in 5... 4... 3... Just kidding! Let's get started!</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the content of the <code class="java">secret-message.txt</code> file.</li>
<li>Log the resulted content to the console without any modification.</li>
<li>Log the message: <code class="java">Finished reading the file</code> after the process is finished.</li>
</ul>
